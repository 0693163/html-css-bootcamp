TRANSITIONS

Transitions are good for changes which occur
from one point to another point.

That's two points:
a beginning point and an end point.

Transitions are good for creating a transition
from that beginning point to the end point.

Transitions create a "TRANSITION".

Here are the CSS PROPERTIES associated with transitions (along with some of the values to which they can be set):

    transition-property: all;
    transition-property: background-color;

    transition-duration: 500ms;

    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;

------- shorthand notation -------
    transition: 3s all 5s ease;
