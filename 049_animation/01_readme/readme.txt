ANIMATIONS

Animations are good for changes which occur
BETWEEN MORE THAN TWO POINTS

That's MORE THAN TWO points.

TRANSITIONS and ANIMATIONS do the same thing.

Transitions do it between TWO points.
Animations do it between TWO OR MORE points.

The result of a transition, or animation, are the same: a gradual change between two (or more) points.

In addition, ANIMATIONS give you more options on what is being changed.

Here are the CSS PROPERTIES associated with ANIMATIONS and their default values:

 animation-name: none
*animation-duration: 0s
 animation-iteration-count: 1
 animation-direction: normal
*animation-timing-function: ease
*animation-delay: 0s
 animation-fill-mode: none
 animation-play-state: running

 (* properties that transition also uses)
 (and transition has this property and animation does not: transition-property: background-color;)
