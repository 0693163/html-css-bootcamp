# Important

If you are having issues with SVGs not displaying, or an error that says "file URLs are treated as unique security origins", you need to run your code from a server.

In the video, I am running my code from webstorm's server.

For your SVG code to work in all browsers, you will need some server to serve your code.

Alternatively, you can try a different browser.

At the time of this writing, the code ran fine in firefox without a server.
